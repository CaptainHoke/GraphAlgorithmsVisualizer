# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

- This app was created as a coursework project for the Java Desktop Developer track on a Hyperskill education platform.

## Notes

- My vacation was over before I finished refactoring, so there are things that can be improved,
  but I'm fairly content with the current basic functionality that is there
- Edge boundary detection I've mentioned is at engineer/omnis/graphviz/components/GraphEdgeComponent.java:64 :^)
