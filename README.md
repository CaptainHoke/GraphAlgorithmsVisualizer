# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

- This app was created as a coursework project for the Java Desktop Developer track on a Hyperskill education platform.

- I've broken edge weight labels rendering, I'll investigate it in the near future ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## Notes

- It's not fully complete and there are things that can be improved,
  but I'm fairly content with the current basic functionality that is there
- There's even an accurate edge boundary detection at engineer/omnis/graphviz/components/GraphEdgeComponent.java:64 :^)
